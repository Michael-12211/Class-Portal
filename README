This git repository is for the figma model of a courses app developed by Michael Kempe.

This prototype is meant to demo the organization and features of a class portal application built after a process of needfinding and assessment of competition.
The main goal was to provide an app capable of handling the core interaction between students and with their professors.
While the professors would be users of this application, profesor-specific features are not included in this demo
The home page provides access to all courses, and the upcoming deadlines option immediately, which is a major concern of students.
The course pages provide links to the important course details, including communciation and evaluation matierials
Each course comes with a student chat room, with additional discussion rooms creatable by the teacher
Within these rooms, students can text their classmates, or even start calls to talk.
The section for professors to upload and display notes is organized into cascading folders, while also offering a search bar for easy locating
Tags can further be created by the professor and associated with each file to allow further organization

Screenshots cannot be uploaded to this file, though a PDF is incldued in this repository with screenshots of the demo screens.
